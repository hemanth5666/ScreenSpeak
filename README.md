Usage of the Code

This Python script screen_text_reader.py is designed to extract text from the screen in real-time using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques. It utilizes the mss library for screen capturing, pytesseract for text extraction, and falcon for text-to-speech functionality. This script can be useful for scenarios where text needs to be extracted from images or screenshots automatically.
Prerequisites

    Python installed on your system.
    Required libraries: cv2, mss, numpy, pytesseract, falcon.
    Ensure Tesseract OCR is installed and configured properly.

Instructions

    Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
    Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Run the script by executing python screen_text_reader.py in your terminal or command prompt.

Code Explanation

    import time: Importing the time module to introduce delays.
    import cv2: Importing the OpenCV library for image processing.
    import mss: Importing the mss library for screen capturing.
    import numpy: Importing numpy for array manipulation.
    import pytesseract: Importing pytesseract for text recognition.
    import falcon: Importing falcon for text-to-speech functionality.
    mon: Dictionary specifying the monitor dimensions.
    Using mss.mss() to initialize the screen capturing object.
    A continuous loop to capture the screen, extract text, and convert it to speech.
    Text extraction from the captured image using pytesseract.image_to_string().
    Speech synthesis of the extracted text using falcon.talk().
    Press 'q' to quit the application.
    Adjusting the capturing and processing frequency based on the application requirements.

Note

    Ensure Tesseract OCR is properly installed and configured on your system.
    Customize the script to adapt to specific screen capture and text extraction needs.
    This script may require adjustments based on your operating system and screen resolution.
